# Hospital Management

**1. Project Overview**
===================

### 1.1 Introduction

The Hospital Management System is a web application designed to manage hospital operations efficiently. The system is built using Django for the back-end and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end. The application provides distinct functionalites for three types of users: Hospital Admin, Doctor, and Patient.

### 1.2 Objectives

* Provide an intuitive platform for hospital administration, allowing for streamlined processes.
* Create a system where doctors can apply for positions and manage their patient appointments effectively.
* Enable patients to book appointments and manage their hospital interactions seamlessly.
* Automate billing and invoicing for discharged patients.

### 1.3 Features and Functionalities

### A. Admin

* **Doctor Management**: Register, view, approve, reject, or delete doctors applying for positions within the hospital.
* **Patient Management**: Admit, view, approve, reject, and discharge patients (discharge patients when treatment is completed).
* **Invoice Management**: Generate and download PDF invoices based on medicine costs, room charges, doctor fees, and additional expenses.
* **Appointment Management**: View, book, and approve patient appointments (approve appointments requested by patients).

### B. Doctor

* **Job Application**: Apply for a job within the hospital and log in only after approval from the hospital admin.
* **Patient Management**: View details of patients assigned by the admin, including symptoms, names, and mobile numbers. Access a list of patients who have been discharged (by admin).
* **Appointment Management**: View appointments booked by the admin. Delete appointments after attending to the patient.

### C. Patient

* **Account Management**: Create an account to seek admission to the hospital and log in only after approval from the hospital admin.
* **Doctor Information**: View assigned doctorâ€™s details, including specialization, mobile number, and address.
* **Appointment Management**: Check the status of booked appointments (pending/confirmed by admin). Book appointments (approval required from admin).
* **Invoice Management**: View and download PDF invoices only after being discharged by the admin.

## Drawbacks/LoopHoles

- Any one can be Admin. There is no Approval required for admin account. So you can disable admin signup process and use any logic like creating superuser.
- There should be at least one doctor in hospital before admitting patient. So first add doctor.
- On update page of doctor/patient you must have to update password.
